Hi there! I am currently an assistant professor in Key Laboratory of Parallel and Distributed Computing (PDL), National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), China.

I joined the [Trustie & OSSEAN](https://www.trustie.net) Group at August 2013, advised by Prof. [Huaimin Wang](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/w/Wang:Huaimin). I received my Ph.D in Software Engineering from NUDT in 2019. 

My main research interest is empirical software engineering, spanning from mining software repositories and social networks, to Docker and CI/CD workflows.

I like movie, music, and photography.
