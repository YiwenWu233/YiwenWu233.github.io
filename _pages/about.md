Hi there! I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate in Key Laboratory of Parallel and Distributed Computing (PDL), National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), China. From 2015 to 2019 (expected). 

I joined the [Trustie & OSSEAN](https://www.trustie.net) Group at August 2013, advised by Prof. [Huaimin Wang](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/w/Wang:Huaimin). Before that I graduated with a B.E. in Computer Science and Technology from NUDT in 2013. 

My main research interest is empirical software engineering, spanning from mining software repositories and social coding networks, to Docker and continuous deployment.

I like movie, music, and photography.
