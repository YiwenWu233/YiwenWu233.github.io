Hi there! I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate in Key Laboratory of Parallel and Distributed Computing (PDL), National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), China. I joined the [Trustie & OSSEAN](https://www.trustie.net) Group at August 2013, advised by Prof. [Huaimin Wang](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/w/Wang:Huaimin). Before that I graduated with a B.E. in Computer Science and Technology from National University of Defense Technology in 2013. My main research interest is empirical software engineering, spanning from mining software repositories and analysing social coding networks, to Docker and continuous deployment. From October 2016 to October 2017, I was visiting and studying in [DECAL Lab](https://decallab.cs.ucdavis.edu/), UC Davis, advised by Prof. [Vladimir Filkov](http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~filkov/).
